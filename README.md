# What is PPG Mod Creator
[PPG Mod Creator](https://cheeteau.github.io/PPG-Mod-Creator/) is a small mod creator that I created in my free time.
The purpose of this site is not to create mods that compete with the workshop mods, it's more for people who don't want to learn how to code for creating mods. So don't expect to be able to create incredible things.

# To do list
I see and read all of your suggestions dw. All of these are good! I promise, but some are too difficult to import or just to do, so please don't be mad or something if I don't add your idea. Still a big thank you for helping!

Elements that have the ⚠️ emoji on them means I've been working on it but have some difficulties, meaning that they might not be enventually implemented.
